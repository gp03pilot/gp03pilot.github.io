Self-organization

Visa - 

esponsive to the spirit of our people.
Swiftly, self-organization emerged. An entire wall became a
pin board with every remaining day calendared across the top.
Someone grabbed an unwashed coffee cup and suspended it on
a long piece of string pinned to the current date. Every element
of work to be done was listed on scraps of paper with the
required completion date and name of the person who had
accepted the work. Anyone could revise the elements, adding
tasks or revising dates, providing they coordinated with others
affected. Everyone, any time, could see the picture emerge and
evolve.They could see how the whole depended on their work,
and how their work was connected to every other part of the
effort. Groups constantly assembled in front of the board as need
and inclination arose, discussing, deciding, and forming work
groups in continuous flow, then dissolving as needs were met.As
each task was completed, its scrap of paper would be removed.
Each day, the cup and string moved inexorably ahead.
Every day, every scrap of paper that fell behind the grimy
string would find an eager group of volunteers to undertake the
work required to remove it. To be able to get one’s own work
done and help another became a sought-after privilege. Nor did
anyone feel beggared by accepting help. Such Herculean effort
meant that at any time, anyone’s task could fall behind and
emerge on the wrong side of the string.
Leaders spontaneously emerged and reemerged, none in
control, but all in order. Ingenuity exploded. People astonished
themselves at what they could accomplish and were amazed at
the suppressed talents emerging in others. Position became
meaningless. Power over others became meaningless. Time
became meaningless. Excitement about doing the impossible
increased, and a community based on purpose, principle, and
people arose. Individuality, self-worth, ingenuity, and creativity
flourished;and as they did,so did the sense of belonging to something larger than self, something beyond immediate gain and
monetary gratification.
No one ever forgot 

No one ever forgot the joy of bringing to work the wholeness of mind,body,and spirit;discovering in the process that such
wholeness is impossible without inseparable connection with
others in the larger purpose of community effort.
Money was a small part of what happened.The effort was
fueled by a spontaneous expansion of the nonmonetary
exchange of value—things done for one another without measurement or prescribed return—the heart and soul of all community. The people gave of themselves without expectation and
received in ways beyond calculation.A few who could not adjust
to the diversity, complexity, and uncertainty wandered away.
Dozens volunteered to take their place. No one articulated what
was happening. No one recorded it. No one measured it. But
everyone felt it, understood it, and loved it.
The dirty string was never replaced and no one washed the
cup. “The Dirty Coffee Cup System” became legendary—a
metaphor within the company for years to come.The BASE 1 system came up on time, under budget, and exceeded all operating
objectives. It forced the industry to abandon notions of natural
monopoly,innovate,and create other systems.It was a foundation
of commitment and practice from which the global Visa communication systems evolved.Out of initial failure,grew a magnificent
success.
