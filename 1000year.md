- Hindu Temples, which are often designed for extremely long lifespans. I need to dive into this more, everything I've found is heavy on spiritual principles and light on construction techniques.

 - [Which is the oldest Hindu temple which still exists? (quora)](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-oldest-Hindu-temple-which-still-exists) - there are a lot of these that are 1500 years old or older. Seem to be mostly made of granite.

- [Does lumber grow stronger with age?](https://www.jlconline.com/how-to/framing/does-lumber-grow-stronger-with-age_o) - TLDR: it does as it loses moisture, but other aging factors reduce strength. In general: no
- [Roman Pantheon (wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome)
- [List of oldest known surviving buildings (wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_known_surviving_buildings) - the older you get, the more the buildings resemble a pile of rocks. They're also mostly tombs, which contradicts the idea that structures should be kept in use. Fewer of these are in the desert than I would have expected.
