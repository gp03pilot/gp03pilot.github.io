<h3 id="about-us">About Us</h3>
<p>Kabri Construction Research was founded in 2022 by Brian and Katrina
Potter. Brian and Katrina both have backgrounds in structural
engineering and have a combined experience in the AEC industry of over
30 years. Between 2018 and 2021, both spent time managing engineering
groups at Katerra where they saw firsthand the excitement and challenges
that come with driving change in the industry. After the leaving
Katerra, they remained passionate about the original ideas that brought
them to Katerra and their desire to be part of the change. From this,
the foundation of Kabri Construction Research was laid.</p>
