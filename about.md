### About Us

Kabri Construction Research was founded in 2022 by Brian and Katrina Potter. Brian and Katrina both have backgrounds in structural engineering and have a combined 30+ years of experience in the AEC industry. Between 2018 and 2021, both spent time managing engineering groups at Katerra where they saw firsthand the excitement and challenges that come with driving change in the industry. After the leaving Katerra, they remained passionate about the original ideas that brought them to Katerra and their desire to be part of the change. From this, the foundation of Kabri Construction Research was laid.
