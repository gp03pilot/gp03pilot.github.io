## Structural Composite Lumber

Structural Composite Lumber is a manufactured wood product used in building construction. Whereas normal lumber is made from boards cut directly from logs, structural composite lumber is made from thin strips or strands of lumber<sup>1</sup> which are then glued together. Unlike normal lumber, which is limited by the dimensions of the tree it came from, SCL can be fabricated in any size, shape or length.

Common types of SCL would be LVL (laminated veneer lumber), LSL (laminated strand lumber), and PSL (parallel strand lumber).

Below are some miscellaneous notes about Structural Composite Lumber.

From [Wood as an Engineering Material:](https://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fpl_gtr190.pdf)

Normal lumber is a non-uniform material, and its strength is often limited by knots or other defects. In SCL these defects are distributed uniformly throughout the section:

>...In contrast with sawn lumber, the strength-reducing characteristics of SCL are dispersed within the veneer or strands
and have much less effect on strength properties. Thus,
relatively high design values can be assigned to strength
properties for both LVL and PSL. Whereas both LSL and
OSL have somewhat lower design values, they have the
advantage of being produced from a raw material that need
not be in a log size large enough for peeling into veneer.
>
>...Veneer for the manufacture of LVL must be carefully selected for the product to achieve the desired engineering
properties. Veneers are often sorted using ultrasonic testing
to ensure that the finished product will have the desired engineering properties.
>
>...Sheets of LVL are commonly produced in 0.6- to 1.2-m
(2- to 4-ft) widths in a thickness of 38 mm (1.5 in.). Continuous presses can be used to form a potentially endless sheet,
which is cut to the desired length<sup>2</sup>.

On the limitations of normal lumber:

>The most extensive efforts at optimizing the use of wood
in large dynamic structures have been in building ships. Two
thousand years of evolutionary shipbuilding technology
reached its zenith in the 16th century with ships capable of
supporting the great voyages of exploration. The fundamentals
of shipbuilding technology of this era were sound enough that
only small improvements were made over the next 300 to 400
years. Essentially the same materials and construction methods
were still used in the great clipper ships of the 19th century.
>
>Up to this point the long evolution of wood technology had
focused upon "the weak link"--the capability of the joint
between individual wood pieces. Wooden ships were built of
thousands of wood parts that all needed to be joined together
with the manufacturing capability then available. The evolution
of shipbuilding essentially relied upon improvements in joint
technology, which allowed larger and larger ships to be built.
However, these ships were far heavier than they needed to
be because only a small fraction of the true structural potential
of wood could be used with the existing types of joints.
>
>With the arrival of manned flight lightweight structural
capability became paramount for the success of aviation. At
this point the true limitations of past wood technologies were
addressed. For the first 30 years of the development of the
airplane, wood was the primary structural material. Pressures
to develop safe, reliable, lightweight structures fueled research
and development efforts that, for the first time, began to
scientifically characterize wood properties. Aircraft engineers
quickly realized that even the best mechanically fastened wood
joints could transfer only a little over 30 percent of downstream
wood material capability. Thus, the full material capability
of wood had rarely been utilized in any of the dynamic wood
structures of the past.
>
>Because of the limitations of early adhesives, bonded wood
joint technology did not become fully viable until the mid 1930's, when more advanced adhesives became available. This
late development, combined with a lack of uniform, consistent
wood physical properties that could be relied upon in a quality
control effort, limited the use of wood in the then rapidly
developing aircraft industry.
>
>Metals quickly gained favor as a safer material for most
larger and faster aircraft. Metals not only possessed more
consistent properties but could be fabricated with a high degree
of reliability by a semiskilled work force. In comparison,
woodworking required a high degree of skill that took a long apprenticeship to acquire.
>
>Major pioneering efforts in wood technology ended at the
close of World War II. One reason was that aluminum alloy
technology evolved quickly in response to the needs of modern
aircraft. This was compounded by wood's past image,
traditions, limitations, and folklore. However, the main reason wood lost favor was related to maintenance. Lack of a viable
moisture protection system for a completed structure was at
the heart of the problem. All wooden structures need some
reasonable moisture stability to prevent internal stressing and
fungus attack. The old wood technology of ships had evolved
to the point where it could successfully deal with large changes
in wood moisture content, but the rot problem was never
solved. Although the development of all-bonded joints solved
the major structural limitation of wood construction, moisture related problems persisted. By 1945, moisture problems were
perceived by the aircraft engineering community as a
fundamental unresolved dilemma that severely limited wood
as a viable engineering material for high-performance dynamic
structures. Another major drawback was the lack of adequate
quality controls that could be implemented in large-scale manufacturing efforts with mass production.
>
>Wood as a living organism remains at a relatively constant
moisture level during its entire lifetime until it is harvested.
The real problem with wood begins after it is cut, when its
moisture level is rather quickly influenced by short-term
changes in local weather conditions. Unprotected wood may
undergo many moisture changes in a short time, and the
repeated expansion and contraction of the wood under these
conditions is thought to be the leading cause of premature wood
aging. Wood over 3000 years old has been taken out of the
tombs of Egypt. Because of the constant temperature and
humidity in which it was stored, the wood was found to have
lost none of the physical properties typical of its species.
This sponge-like capacity to take on and give off moisture
at the whim of the surrounding environment is the root cause
of nearly all of the problems with wood. Specifically, varying
moisture levels in wood are responsible for dimensional
instability, internal stressing that can lead to checking and
cracking, potential loss of strength and sifttness, and decay due to dry rot.
>
>Dimensional instability has always been a factor limiting
the use of wood in many engineering applications where
reasonable tolerances on size must be maintained. To
complicate matters, the dimensional instability of wood has
never been constant. It varies widely between species of wood
and depends strongly on how the wood is cut from the tree.
Referring to figure 5, radial-grain wood (cut perpendicular
to annual rings) in most species is more stable than is
tangential-grain wood (cut parallel to annual rings). The
dimensional change of wood due to moisture changes always
occurs on outer surfaces first, caused by differing moisture
levels within the same piece of wood. This can lead to internal
stressing that often causes surface checking and cracking.

### Footnotes:
1. Both PSL and LVL is made from strands 1/8" to 1/10" thick.
2. This is similar to precast hollowcore plank, which is also manufactured in a continuous sheet. Hot rolled steel also seems to be fabricated this way.
