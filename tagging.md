# The Problem with Tagging (in progress)

###### *last updated: 03/11/19*

problem with tagging is that it presumes a knowledge of all the tags. This requires you to either know all the things you'll want to look for in the future (unlikely), or that you'll be forced to shoe-horn future items into a current classification system

It's similar to the problem of categorization.

Too many/too few tags/categories are useless

as soon as you add a new tag/category, your whole system collapses, unless you go back and re-tag everything

tagging is reverse search - instead of looking for what you want by search term, you're trying to guess what search terms you'll be using later. Ie, you're trying to anticipate the mind of future you. tagging is therefore an inherently self-limiting venture, as it relies on you knowing your own future mind

It's surprisingly easy to scan large number of items (hundreds, certainly). categorization in most cases is premature, where what you really want is a bigass list

categorization closes off future avenues of consideration. Refusing to categorize lets you think about things in a new way in the future

why don't we have AOL keywords anymore? Seems related

tagging/categorization similar to a folder structure. A folder structure is most useful where multiple people are going to be using a group of files, or you want to keep a group of files deliberately separate. If neither of these things are true, in general enforcing a folder structure onto files is unnecessary (and actually a negative, as it makes things harder to find)

tagging is intended to make things easier to find. But it makes things harder to find.

Don't use tags. Use lists
