<h1 id="toc_1">How to Write a Structural Engineering Resume.</h1>

<p>Recently I was responsible for hiring a team engineers for a new branch of a structural engineering department. Over the course of a year and a half, I looked at hundreds of resumes, and talked and interviewed with dozens of candidates. And it was shocking how often even extremely experienced engineers had resumes that didn&#39;t communicate how strong a candidate they were.</p>

<p>Writing a good structural engineering resume is slightly different than writing a normal resume. It&#39;s easy to know the standard resume best practices, such as those from askamanager.org, and still end up with one that doesn&#39;t communicate your structural qualifications (I should know - for years this was what my resume looked like.) The important thing is to know what structural hiring managers care about, and making sure to highlight that information.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the information hiring managers will generally want to know:</p>

<p><strong>What projects have you worked on?</strong> 
Structural engineering experience is most commonly measured in terms of project experience. What projects have you worked on? What type of buildings were they? What level of responsibility did you have? How big were they? Where were they built? What sort of structural system did they use? Is there anything noteworthy about them? (Did they have a rapid timetable? Did they win a design award? Was the client noteworthy? Did they require going outside normal building codes or design procedures?)</p>

<p><strong>What materials, codes, and standards do you know?</strong>
These blend together, because your material experience will generally (but not always) be measured in terms of how well you know the documented standards. You&#39;ll want to list both the &quot;common standards&quot; you know (ACI 318, AISC, ASCE 7, ACI 530, NDS, etc), as well as any uncommon ones (Do you know ACI 350? ASCE 32? AISC DG-11?) The common ones won&#39;t differentiate you, but will be generally be table stakes. Uncommon ones will only matter to a subset of employers, but will be a big deal to the ones who care about it.</p>

<p><strong>Whats your license status?</strong>
Having a PE is important for structural engineering hires. If you have it, you should display it, as well as which states you&#39;re licensed in. If you&#39;ve passed the SE exam, display that as well. If you&#39;re eligible to take the test and haven&#39;t yet, that is generally going to be seen as a red flag.</p>

<p><strong>What software have you used?</strong>
This falls into a similar category to materials and software - common ones (the big 3: Risa, CSI, and RAM) will be expected knowledge, less common ones (SBEDS, OASYS) will make you valuable to certain employers. In general, it&#39;s less common for employers to screen heavily on software experience - the assumption is often that you&#39;ll be able to pick up any software skills you don&#39;t have relatively quickly.</p>

<p><strong>If you&#39;re still in school</strong> 
You&#39;ll want to list what structural classes you&#39;ve taken, particularly any material design classes.</p>

<p>Everything else is fairly standard resume advice. List your duties, your accomplishments (ideally stated in terms of money or time saved or business goals), initiatives you were part of, degrees you&#39;ve attained, etc. Keep it to 2 pages or less. Put your email, address, and phone number at the top. </p>

<p>A template you can use to build your own resume is below:</p>
