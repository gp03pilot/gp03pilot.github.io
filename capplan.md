Elements to consider in the engineering capacity planning problem:

Forecasting is probabilistic in nature (as is any sort of forecasting); at any given time, several different projects are being pursued, each of which only ahve a possibility of being won. This probabilistic nature continues at each stage of the project - a project may be won and then only proceed through SD, or DD, or CD, etc. 

In addition, projects are also probabilistic with respect to time - they generally have projected start dates which almost always vary (generally, they vary by moving farther into the future).

If a project becomes real, it will need to be staffed by engineers. Projects are almost always staffed by hours estimates (the same hours estimates that are used to bid the job). Project deliverables generally consist of two portions: the calculations, and the set of drawings themselves. Calculations can either be their own deliverable, or simply a required step in producing the drawings.

Though projects are typically staffed based on hours estimates, they are perhaps better thought of as a sequence of tasks that must be completed. These tasks have different levels of expertise and experience that are required, and are assigned accordingly. Junior, less experienced engineers are assigned certain tasks, and more difficult ones are reserved for more experienced engineers. in addition, some tasks may require specific knowledge that only some engineers have (ie: how to design for mass timber).

A trade-off exists between experience level, efficiency, and cost. Junior engineers are less expensive, but take longer to complete their work, make more mistakes, and can complete fewer total tasks. More experienced engineers are more efficient at completing tasks, but are more expensive.

It takes a certain amount of time to be brought up to speed on a project (ie: there are transaction costs). Conversely, however, engineers staffed to a project tend to find ways to fill their time with it, especially if they have no other urgent tasks.

(something about queueing theory here).

Engineers require inputs from other disciplines to complete their work. However, these other disciplines also require input from engineering, and are undergoing similar scheduling problems at the same time. In some sense it is in everyone's best interest to wait for other folks to complete their work before they do their own, so as not to waste time - however, if everyone does that, then no work gets done. There is thus a circular reference problem.

This brings us to one other level of uncertainty - scope uncertainty. It is likely that the project will change requirements at some point during the design process due to changing customer requirements. (when these changes will occur is also uncertain). It's only on occasion that additional funds are given for these changes - however, they always take time to complete.

How an engineering project typically proceeds, from a work standpoint.

Building design generally proceeds through multiple phases. It starts with conceptual design, where the architect and the customer work out what the customer's needs are, what his budget is, jurisdiction requirements, space limitations, etc. At the end of this phase there is an approximate layout of the building on the site, along with a rough idea of how it will look, how the units will be laid out, what the occupancy type is, what the total cost is, etc.

It proceeds from there to schematic design. This is when the various engineering disciplines work out roughly what the requirements will be for the building. For structural, this is the gravity load system, the lateral system, the approximate member depths, the type of foundation, etc. The extent of the SD design phase will vary. For buildings that are relatively simple that the firm has experience in, the SD might only be a few paragraphs of written description. For a more complicated project, it might be a full (preliminary) set of drawings, along with significant calculation effort to ensure the structural systems will work. the SD phase is typically 10% of the total structural fee.

It then proceeds on to DD (design development). This is where most of the framing decisions are made, foundation design worked out, etc. At the end of this stage you should have the structural problems largely solved, or at least know that they are solvable. Deliverable is typically a set of plan sheets, and a basic set of construction details. DD is typically 15-25% of the structural fee

The next phase is construction documents (CD). These are the set of plans that will be submitted for permit. Everything about the structure must be worked out at this stage, all members sized, all framing conditions detailed, along with specs, general notes, etc. At this stage all information on how to build the building must be worked out. CD is generally 30-50% of the structural fee

From there, it proceeds to construction administration (CA), the engineering effort required during the construction phase. This involves checking shop drawings for structural elements, answering RFIs, answering field questions, providing fixes that are required, and performing site observation. CA is typically 20-30% of the structural fee.

As mentioned previously, there are two tasks that must be completed - the calculations and the drawings (with the calculations determining what goes on the drawings). The calculations make up roughly 25% of the work, while the drawings require roughly 75% of the work (1/3rd to 1/2 of which is spent by whoever is doing the drawings).

A good drafter will be able to make substantial, correct progress on the drawings without needing an engineer's input. A less experienced or weak one will need a lot of engineer's time, will make frequent mistakes that need to be corrected by the engineer (as will anyone less experienced), will be slower (as will anyone less experienced).

The design proceeds hierarchically. It's first broken down into gravity, lateral, and foundation. It will then further broken down into specific material design (gravity steel, gravity wood, lateral steel, lateral wood, etc). It is then broken down further into specific tasks (design the load bearing walls on these gridlines, design these headers, design these shearwalls). 

A large issue with getting tasks completed is the varied inputs they require. Some tasks require other tasks to be completed before they can be started (ie: doing shearwall design requires calculating the lateral loads). Some tasks can be started before others but require them to be finished before they can be finished. Some tasks require starting, so that information produced by starting can complete another task, which is then required to finish the original task (ie: laying out shearwalls. You need to take a first guess which walls need to be shearwalls, then proceed with the shearwall design, then adjust the number/location of walls based on those initial calculations). Some tasks need to be completed in parallel, with each one informing the other until they're both complete. And as mentioned previously, different tasks are appropriate for different levels of experience (generally, gravity design and spread footings can be done by less experienced engineers, lateral design and connection design requires more experienced engineers). More experienced engineers will check the work of less experienced ones, sometimetimes requiring changes either due to mistakes, or due to changes to make it more efficient based on their experience.

This is the fundamental difficulty with project completion - many tasks are to greater or lesser degree iterative. Both within structural (shearwall layout/shearwall design), and between disciplines (coordinating pipe location and member location, etc.)

A calculation task is completed when it produces a design. This design information is then transferred to the drafter, which can be done in a variety of ways. A markup on the existing drawings, a sketch of a new detail to draw, etc. The drafter completes the task, then informs the engineer, who backchecks the work. Often this requires several rounds; sometimes the drafter will miss things, or not make the correct markups (either because they didn't understand or because the engineer was unclear), sometimes the engineer only gives initial markups and doesn't give all the information at once (sometimes because it'd be too difficult, or they don't have it all, etc.). Once the markups have been completed.the drafter proceeds onto the next task until the whole set of drawings is completed. Proceeding this way, the drawings are finished.

Often times the building will change during the design process. This is because (iterative process again), the architect is figuring out the building as they go, and sometimes a change that will affect the engineers is required. Other times, the owner changes their requirements for various reasons (too expensive, feedback from earlier sets of drawings, etc. This requires figuring out the effects of the change, producing a new set of tasks, then completing them as above.

(something something QC process, manufacturability/constructability review)

overall what we see: a lot of mistakes, quality checks that require rework. A lot of changes based on lack of experience, and changes due to the iterative process of design.
