*On direct labor:*

> The number of manufacturing operations required to complete a part probably is the greatest single determinant of direct labor cost. Each operation involves a “pick up and locate” and a “remove and set aside” of the material or part, and usually additional inspection by the operators is necessary. In addition, as the number of operations increases, indirect costs tend to accelerate. The chances for cumulative dimensional error are increased owing to changing locating points and surfaces. More setups are required; scrap and rework increase; timekeeping, counting, and paperwork expand; and shop scheduling becomes more complex.


*On special tooling:*

> With high production vol- ume, a substantial investment in tools normally can be readily justified by the reduc- tion in direct labor unit cost, since the total tooling cost amortized over many units of product results in a low tooling cost per unit. For low-volume-production applications, even moderate tooling costs can contribute relatively high unit tooling costs.

*On Basic Principles of Designing for Economical Production:*

> The following principles, applicable to virtually all manufacturing processes, will aid designers in specifying components and products that can be manufactured at minimum cost.
> > 1. **Simplicity.** Other factors being equal, the product with the fewest parts, the least intricate shape, the fewest precision adjustments, and the shortest manufacturing sequence will be the least costly to produce. Additionally, it usually will be the most reliable and the easiest to service.> 2. **Standard materials and components.** Use of widely available materials and off- the-shelf parts enables the benefits of mass production to be realized by even low-unit- quantity products. Use of such standard components also simplifies inventory management, eases purchasing, avoids tooling and equipment  investments, and speeds the manufacturing cycle.> 3. **Standardized design of the product itself.** When several similar products are to be produced, specify the same materials, parts, and subassemblies for each as much as possible. This procedure will provide economies of scale for component production, simplify process control and operator training, and reduce the investment required for tooling and equipment.> 4. **Liberal tolerances.** Although the extra cost of producing too tight tolerances has been well documented, this fact is often not appreciated well enough by product designers. The higher costs of tight tolerances stem from factors such as:
  1. extra operations such as grinding, honing, or lapping after primary machining operations 
  2. higher tooling costs from the greater precision needed initially when the tools are made and the more frequent and more careful maintenance needed as they wear
  3. longer operating cycles
  4. higher scrap and rework costs
  5. the need for more skilled and highly trained workers
  6. higher materials costs
  7. more sizable investments for precision equipment.> 5. **Use of the most processible materials.** Use the most processible materials available as long as their functional characteristics and cost are suitable. There are often sig- nificant differences in processibility (cycle time, optimal cutting speed, flowability, etc.) between conventional material grades and those developed for easy processibility. However, in the long run, the most economical material is the one with the lowest combined cost of materials, processing, and warranty and service charges over the designed life of the product.> 6. **Teamwork with manufacturing personnel.** The most producible designs are provided when the designer and manufacturing personnel, particularly manufacturing engineers, work closely together as a team or otherwise collaborate from the outset.

> 7. **Avoidance of secondary operations.** Consider the cost of operations, and design in order to eliminate or simplify them whenever possible. Such operations as deburring, inspection, plating and painting, heat treating, material handling, and others may prove to be as expensive as the primary manufacturing operation and should be considered as the design is developed. For example, firm, nonambiguous gauging points should be provided; shapes that require special protective trays for handling should be avoided.> 8. **Design appropriate to the expected level of production.** The design should be suit- able for a production method that is economical for the quantity forecast. For example, a product should not be designed to utilize a thin-walled die casting if anticipated produc- tion quantities are so low that the cost of the die cannot be amortized. Conversely, it also may be incorrect to specify a sand-mold aluminum casting for a mass-produced part because this may fail to take advantage of the labor and materials savings possible with die castings.> 9. **Utilizing special process characteristics.** Wise designers will learn the special capabilities of the manufacturing processes that are applicable to their products and take advantage of them. For example, they will know that injection-molded plastic parts can have color and surface texture incorporated in them as they come from the mold, that some plastics can provide “living hinges,” that powder-metal parts normally have a porous nature that allows lubrication retention and obviates the need for separate bushing inserts, etc. Utilizing these special capabilities can eliminate many operations and the need for separate, costly components.> 10. **Avoiding process restrictiveness.** On parts drawings, specify only the final characteristics needed; do not specify the process to be used. Allow manufacturing engineers as much latitude as possible in choosing a process that produces the needed dimensions, surface finish, or other characteristics required.

*General Design Rules:*

> 1. First in importance, simplify the design. Reduce the number of parts required. This can be done most often by combining parts, designing one part so that it performs several functions.
> 2. Design for low-labor-cost operations whenever possible. For example, a punch- press pierced hole can be made more quickly than a hole can be drilled. Drilling, in turn, is quicker than boring. Tumble deburring requires less labor than hand deburring.
> 3. Avoid generalized statements on drawings that may be difficult for manufacturing personnel to interpret. Examples are “Polish this surface....Corners must be square,” “Tool marks are not permitted,” and “Assemblies must exhibit good workmanship.” Notes must be more specific than these.
> 4. Dimensions should be made not from points in space but from specific surfaces or points on the part itself if at all possible. This facilitates fixture and gauge making and helps avoid tooling, gauge, and measurement errors.
> 5. Dimensions should all be from one datum line rather than from a variety of points to simplify tooling and gauging and avoid overlap of tolerances.
> 6. Once functional requirements have been fulfilled, the lighter the part, the lower its cost is apt to be. Designers should strive for minimum weight consistent with strength and stiffness requirements. Along with a reduction in materials costs, there usually will be a reduction in labor and tooling costs when less material is used.
> 7. Whenever possible, design to use general-purpose tooling rather than special tooling (dies, form cutters, etc.). The well-equipped shop often has a large collection of standard tooling that is usable for a variety of parts. Except for the highest levels of produc- tion, where the labor and materials savings of special tooling enable their costs to be amortized, designers should become familiar with the general-purpose and standard tool- ing that is available and make use of it.
> 8. Avoid sharp corners; use generous fillets and radii. This is a universal rule applicable to castings and molded, formed, and machined parts. Generously rounded corners provide a number of advantages. There is less stress concentration on the part and on the tool; both will last longer. Material will flow better during manufacture. There may be fewer operational steps. Scrap rates will be reduced.
>  There are some exceptions to this “no sharp corner” rule, however. Two intersecting machined surfaces will leave a sharp external corner, and there is no cost advantage in trying to prevent it. The external corners of a powder-metal part, where surfaces formed by the punch face intersect surfaces formed by the die walls, will be sharp. For other cor- ners, however, generous radii and fillets are greatly preferable.
> 9. Design a part so that as many manufacturing operations as possible can be per- formed without repositioning it. This reduces handling and the number of operations but,equally important, promotes accuracy, since the needed precision can be built into the tooling and equipment.
> 10. Whenever possible, cast, molded, or powder-metal parts should be designed so that stepped parting lines are avoided. These increase mold and pattern complexity and cost.
> 11. With all casting and molding processes, it is a good idea to design workpieces so that wall thicknesses are as uniform as possible. With high-shrinkage materials (e.g., plastics and aluminum), the need is greater.
> 12. Space holes in machined, cast, molded, or stamped parts so that they can be made in one operation without tooling weakness. Most processes have limitations on the closeness with which holes can be made simultaneously because of the lack of strength of thin die sections, material-flow problems in molds, or the difficulty in putting multiple machining spindles close together.
