<h1 id="toc_1">List of Structural Engineering Resources on the Net</h1>

<p>Here&#39;s a list of engineering resources around the net I&#39;ve found useful.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Building Codes</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.org/details/publicsafetycode">Archive.org</a> Public Safety Codes: Collection of various building codes available for download. Particularly useful is every version of the IBC – <a href="http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.2000">2000</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.2003">2003</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.2006">2006</a>, <a href="http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.209">2009</a> and <a href="http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.2012">2012</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/">Public.Resource.org Building Codes</a>: Another online code collection, largely overlaps with archive.org.</li>
<li><a href="ttp://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/">PublicCodes.Cyberregs.com</a>: Online code repository maintained by the ICC. Doesn’t allow downloading, and navigating is an extreme pain.</li>
<li><a href="https://up.codes/codes/">Up.Codes</a>: Online access to most state-specific building codes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_3">Wind and Earthquake Maps</h3>

<ul>
<li>USGS Seismic Hazard Maps: Maps of ground acceleration used by ASCE.</li>
<li>Wind Speed Map: Utility for finding wind speed, maintained by ATC.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_4">Old Construction</h3>

<ul>
<li>structuralsafety.com: Several links to information on old rebar and old construction.</li>
<li>Sliderule Era: Out of print engineering publications made freely available.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_5">Bridges</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://uglybridges.com/">UglyBridges.com</a>: User-friendly interface for National Bridge Inventory data.</li>
<li><a href="http://nationalbridges.com/">Nationalbridges.com</a>: Another online parsing of NBI data.</li>
<li><a href="http://bridgehunter.com/">Bridgehunter.com</a>: Database of notable bridges, past and present.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dot.state.mn.us/bridge/pdf/aestheticguidelinesforbridgedesign.pdf">Minnesota DOT Aesthetic Guidelines for Bridges</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/Bridge/Aesthetics_Sourcebook.pdf">Bridge Aesthetics Sourcebook</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_6">Engineering Magazines</h3>

<ul>
<li>Structure Magazine: Articles on various structural engineering topics, available free (including all back issues). I particularly like their Antiquated Structural Systems series.</li>
<li>Structural Engineer: Another structural engineering magazine.</li>
<li>Modern Steel Construction: Articles focusing on steel construction. Current and back issues all freely available.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_7">Misc. Resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Earthquake Engineering Online Archive (NISEE): Many publications about earthquake engineering. Membership costs a one-time fee of $25.</li>
<li>S.K. Ghosh: Articles on structural engineering and building codes, written by one of the premier engineers of our time.</li>
<li>Reed Construction Data: Economic and cost data for the construction industry, as well as a breakdown of the building code adoption by state.</li>
<li>ASCE Library: If you feel like paying an arm and a leg, there’s a large library of structural engineering articles available.</li>
<li>PCI Technical Resources: Back issues of the PCI Journal, load tables from every edition of the PCI handbook, and a variety of other precast design resources, all freely available.</li>
<li>ACI Free Downloads: Freely available publications of some of the more minor ACI Committees. There’s also a large library of articles from the various ACI publications, many available for free to ACI members.</li>
<li>AISC ePubs and freePubs: Technical publications from AISC, including journal articles and historical standards. Some require AISC to access.</li>
<li>NFPA Research: Fire statistics and reports from the NFPA.</li>
<li>Google Books: If it’s a hundred years old or so, it’s probably available for free on Google books. Lots of great engineering publications here.</li>
<li>Historic American Engineering Record: Prints and photographs documenting achievements in architecture, engineering, and landscape design from the Library of Congress.</li>
<li>FEMA Library: Library of freely available FEMA publications, including NEHRP publications.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_8">Simpson Resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>Simpson Wood Connectors Catalog</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_9">Forums and Mailing Lists</h3>

<ul>
<li>ICC Code Forum: Discussion of the various I-Codes</li>
<li>Eng-Tips: Forums for various engineering issues.</li>
<li>SEAINT Mail Archive: Structural Engineer’s Association mailing list archive, going back to 1995.</li>
<li>DesignToEurocodes.com: Forum for Eurocode design.</li>
