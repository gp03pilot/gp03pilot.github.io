<h2 id="horizontal-shear-capacity-of-concrete-joints">Horizontal Shear Capacity of Concrete Joints</h2>
<p>It’s often infeasible to pour a concrete structural element all at one time. Because of this, pours are often split up - the contractor may pour foundation grade beams, and then back and pour the slab on top. Or they may set a precast concrete floor, and then pour a concrete topping over them. Differently timed concrete pours will leave horizontal joints in through the concrete, creating a composite member.</p>
<p>Because horizontal shear will be transferred across this joint, it’s necessary to know it’s capacity to resist load. These provisions for calculating its capacity are given in ACI 318-19 Table 16.4.4.2:</p>
<p><img src="table16442.PNG" alt="table16442" /><br />
</p>
<p>The code gives a severe penalty to concrete without shear reinforcing crossing the joint, and to concrete not roughened to a +-1/4" amplitude (with a roughened surface being required for an unreinforced joint). The maximum capacity of an unreinforced concrete joint is 80 psi.</p>
<p>Roughening a concrete surface to 1/4" amplitude and installing shear reinforcing are both labor-intensive, time consuming and costly. So it’s useful to examine the source of this provision, particularly the 80 psi value for an unreinforced joint.</p>
<hr />
<p>According the the commentary, these load capacities are based on research done in the early 60’s:</p>
<p><img src="R16442.PNG" alt="R16442" /><br />
</p>
<p>However, looking at these sources makes it unclear where the 80 psi comes from.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.concrete.org/publications/internationalconcreteabstractsportal.aspx?m=details&amp;ID=51685340">Kaar (1960)</a> ran no tests for horizontal shear through unreinforced joints.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.concrete.org/publications/internationalconcreteabstractsportal.aspx?m=details&amp;ID=19425">Hanson (1960)</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The girder and push-off tests reported herein indicate a maximum shearing stress for composite action of 500 psi for a rough bonded surface and 300 psi for a smooth bonded surface. The compressive strengths of the concretes were 3000 and 5000 psi for the slab and girder, respectively.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.concrete.org/publications/internationalconcreteabstractsportal/m/details/id/16707">Saemann and Washa (1964)</a> give an equation based on % steel, shear span, and effective depth, with unreinforced joint capacity ranging from 450psi to 200psi:</p>
<p><img src="saemann1964.PNG" alt="saemann1964" /><br />
</p>
<p>So where does the 80psi value come from?</p>
<hr />
<p>If we dig back, we find that this 80 psi value is very near the lower bound value of 78 psi that first appears in a report from ACI-ASCE Committee 333 in its 1960 report:</p>
<p><img src="aci333.PNG" alt="aci333" /><br />
</p>
<p>78 psi is the given horizonal shear strength of specimen A2 (though its worth noting that all the unreinforced joints had a smooth surface). The committee used this data to recommend a bond value of 80 psi for smooth surfaces:</p>
<p><img src="aci333_2.PNG" alt="aci333_2" /><br />
</p>
<p>The 80 psi value was incorporated into ACI 318-71 for both smooth reinforced and rough reinforced, and have been unchanged ever since:</p>
<p><img src="aci333_3.PNG" alt="aci333_3" /><br />
</p>
<p>The source of A2 is reference 9, “Behavior of Composite Lintel Beams in Bending” Ozell (1956). This publication is currently unavailable from PCI, however, we can find it discussed in a CTA Technical Bulletin from 1974:</p>
<p><img src="CTA74.PNG" alt="CTA74" /><br />
</p>
<p>The value of 78 psi seems to have been copied incorrectly. In fact, nearly all the values from table 2 are different than their original source:</p>
<p><img src="CTA74_2.PNG" alt="CTA74_2" /><br />
</p>
<p>There is no source of the 80 psi value for horizontal shear - it’s inclusion is due to a typo made 60 years ago.</p>
<hr />
<p>So if the value of 80 psi is based on nothing, what is the actual capacity of an unreinforced horizontal concrete joint?</p>
<p>The research in this area is summarized in <a href="https://preserve.lehigh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2018&amp;context=etd">Kovach (2008):</a></p>
<p><img src="kovach2008.PNG" alt="kovach2008" /><br />
<img src="kovach2008_2.PNG" alt="kovach2008_2" /><br />
</p>
<p>The samples vary in concrete strength, surface finish, testing conditions, and preparation prior to pouring (with some being deliberately fabricated in such a way to prevent a bond from forming), making it difficult to draw direct conclusions beyond the obvious conservatism of the 80 psi limit.</p>
<p>Running his own series of tests, Kovach achieves the following results:</p>
<p><img src="kovach2008_3.PNG" alt="kovach2008_3" /><br />
<img src="kovach2008_4.PNG" alt="kovach2008_4" /><br />
</p>
<p>The horizontal shear strengths of an unreinforced joint as calculated by Kovach (and consistent with previous research) are 6-10 times that of the value currently required by ACI.</p>
<p>Given the existing provisions provenance, and the results of more recent research, ACI should consider re-examining these provisions.</p>
