<h2 id="horizontal-shear-capacity-of-concrete-joints">Horizontal Shear Capacity of Concrete Joints</h2>
<p>It’s often infeasible to pour a concrete structural element all at one time. Because of this, pours are often split up - the contractor may pour foundation grade beams, and then back and pour the slab on top. Or they may set a precast concrete floor, and then pour a concrete topping over them. Differently timed concrete pours will leave horizontal joints in through the concrete, creating a composite member.</p>
<p>Because horizontal shear will be transferred across this joint, it’s necessary to know it’s capacity to resist load. These provisions for calculating its capacity are given in ACI 318-19 Table 16.4.4.2:</p>
<p><img src="table16442.PNG" alt="table16442" /><br />
</p>
<p>The code gives a severe penalty to concrete without shear reinforcing crossing the joint, and to concrete not roughened to a +-1/4" amplitude (with a roughened surface being required for an unreinforced joint). The maximum capacity of an unreinforced concrete joint is 80 psi.</p>
<p>Roughening a concrete surface to 1/4" amplitude and installing shear reinforcing are both labor-intensive, time consuming and costly. So it’s useful to examine the source of this provision, particularly the 80 psi value for an unreinforced joint.</p>
<hr />
<p>According the the commentary, these load capacities are based on research done in the early 60’s:</p>
<p><img src="R16442.PNG" alt="R16442" /><br />
</p>
<p>However, looking at these sources makes it unclear where the 80 psi comes from.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.concrete.org/publications/internationalconcreteabstractsportal.aspx?m=details&amp;ID=51685340">Kaar (1960)</a> ran no tests for horizontal shear through unreinforced joints.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.concrete.org/publications/internationalconcreteabstractsportal.aspx?m=details&amp;ID=19425">Hanson (1960)</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The girder and push-off tests reported herein indicate a maximum shearing stress for composite action of 500 psi for a rough bonded surface and 300 psi for a smooth bonded surface. The compressive strengths of the concretes were 3000 and 5000 psi for the slab and girder, respectively.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.concrete.org/publications/internationalconcreteabstractsportal/m/details/id/16707">Saemann and Washa (1964)</a> give an equation based on % steel, shear span, and effective depth, with unreinforced joint capacity ranging from 450psi to 200psi:</p>
<p><img src="saemann1964.PNG" alt="saemann1964" /><br />
</p>
<p>So where does the 80psi value come from?</p>
<hr />
<p>If we dig back, we find that the 80 psi value first appears in ACI-ASCE Committee 333 “Tentative Recommendations for Design of Composite Beams and Girders for Buildings”.</p>
<p><img src="aci333_2.PNG" alt="aci333_2" /><br />
</p>
<p>These recommendations are based on horizontal shear capacities of 78 beams tested, nine of which failed in horizontal shear. Of these, only 3 of these members had unreinforced joints, all of which were smooth:</p>
<p><img src="aci333.PNG" alt="aci333" /><br />
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the data in Table 2 appears to have been copied incorrectly. We can find it discussed in a CTA Technical Bulletin from 1974:</p>
<p><img src="CTA74.PNG" alt="CTA74" /><br />
</p>
<p><img src="CTA74_2.PNG" alt="CTA74_2" /><br />
</p>
<p>Based on this data, the committee recommended a shear capacity value of 80 psi for smooth surfaces with reinforcement, and 400 psi for rough surfaces with reinforcement. They describe these values as incorporating a 2 to 2.5 safety factor, though it is unclear what that is based on - for instance, the largest horizontal shear capacity with a roughened joint is only 580 psi, a less than 1.5 safety factor over 400.</p>
<p>The committee deliberately abstined from making a recommendation for unreinforced joints:</p>
<p><img src="aci333_4.PNG" alt="aci333_4" /><br />
</p>
<p>Despite this, the 80 psi value was incorporated into ACI 318-71 as the recommended value for both smooth reinforced joints, and rough unreinforced joints.</p>
<p><img src="aci333_3.PNG" alt="aci333_3" /><br />
</p>
<p>That value has remained unchanged in the code ever since.</p>
<hr />
<p>So if the value of 80 psi is based on nothing, what is the actual capacity of an unreinforced horizontal concrete joint?</p>
<p>Much of the research in this area is summarized in <a href="https://preserve.lehigh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2018&amp;context=etd">Kovach (2008):</a></p>
<p><img src="kovach2008.PNG" alt="kovach2008" /><br />
<img src="kovach2008_2.PNG" alt="kovach2008_2" /><br />
</p>
<p>The samples vary in concrete strength, surface finish, testing conditions, and preparation prior to pouring (with some being deliberately fabricated in such a way to prevent a bond from forming), making it difficult to draw direct conclusions beyond the obvious conservatism of the 80 psi limit.</p>
<p>Running his own series of tests, Kovach achieves the following results:</p>
<p><img src="kovach2008_3.PNG" alt="kovach2008_3" /><br />
<img src="kovach2008_4.PNG" alt="kovach2008_4" /><br />
</p>
<p>The horizontal shear strengths of an unreinforced joint as calculated by Kovach (and consistent with previous research) range from 435 psi to 571 psi, 6-10 times that of the value currently required by ACI.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another comprehensive study of shear capacity was performed by Loov and Pataik (1994). Running their own series of tests, and summarizing the data of 5 previous studies, they approximate the horizontal shear capacity of a concrete joint as:</p>
<p><img src="loov1994.PNG" alt="loov1994" /><br />
</p>
<p>Where k is 0.5 for joints, and 0.6 for monolithic pours. This equation provides a reasonable lower bound of capacity:</p>
<p><img src="loov1994_2.PNG" alt="loov1994_2" /><br />
</p>
<p>For 4000 psi concrete and the recommended k value of 0.5 an unreinforced joint would have a 122 psi capacity (a value which conservatively does not take surface roughness into account, as capacity varies substantially with roughness).</p>
<hr />
<p>Regardless of the formula used, given the provenance of existing, and the results of more recent research, ACI should consider re-examining these provisions.</p>
