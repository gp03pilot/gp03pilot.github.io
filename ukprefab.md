# UK Post-war Prefabs

At the end of World War II, England faced a severe housing shortage. Wartime rationing had put a halt to new construction during the war, and thousands of houses had been destroyed or damaged during the blitz. England needed to built an estimated 200,000 houses. But traditional building materials, such as timber or brick, were in short supply, as were skilled craftsman. And even if they were available, the houses were needed immediately - there wasn’t time to build them using typical construction methods.
 
In the face of these challenges, the Ministry of Works instituted a strategy of building thousands of pre-fabricated houses. These could be partially manufactured using now-idle munitions factories, and then shipped and assembled on-site by an unskilled labor force. There were many different flavors of these ‘pre-fabs’, all designed based on a standard ‘portal’ bungalow. Some of these were designed to be temporary, with a lifespan of only 10 years - some were designed to be more permanent. They were built out of a variety of materials: timber, precast concrete, cold-formed steel. Some even used repurposed military vehicle parts as structural members. This house-building project was known as the Emergency Factory Made program.
