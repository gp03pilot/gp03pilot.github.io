## Notes on "How Buildings Learn"

 - Buildings made of several different layers - site, structure, skin, services, spaceplan, stuff. These change at different rates:
  - site is unchanging
  - structure lasts the lifetime of the building
  - services are the electrical, mechanical, plumbing, cabling, etc, last 10-15 years
  - spaceplan is the layout of partitions, wall panels, etc. which changes every 5 to 7 years
  - stuff is the furniture, which changes on the order of weeks or months
- interaction mostly takes palce within a layer (forest analogy - the hummingbirds don't notice the redwoods), and the slow moving layers define the set of options available to the other layers
- Thus buildings are constantly changing and adapting over time, at different rates
- This is why it's best to not have all systems/structure combined, to let the fast layers change without damaging the slow layers, and without the slow layers restricting the fast layers
- Problem with architecture is that it treats buildings as art and thus unable to be changed, when to be successful buildings need to be changed constantly throughout their lives, as society changes and the building is forced to change with it. Factories become lofts, warehouses become offices, etc.
- if building stock changes at 2-3% a year, a city compeltely renews every 50 years. Buildings shouldn't be treated as permanent, but should be considered changeable
- zoning, real estate prices should encourage this changeability, but in practice often don't.
 - overly strict zoning prevents adaptations to new uses taking place
 - rapidly falling prices mean it's not worth it to do mainteance (and all buildings need maintenance) and the building rots
 - rapidly increasing/expensive prices mean it's not worth it to try to keep a building as the cost is dominated by the land itself, and they're constantly being torn down and replaced
