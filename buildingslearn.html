<h2 id="toc_1">Notes on &quot;How Buildings Learn&quot; by Stewart Brand</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Buildings-Learn-Happens-Theyre/dp/0140139966">A book</a> about the adaptations buildings go through over their (sometimes very long) life. The most useful thing for me was the framework for thinking about those adaptations. My notes, list-style:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buildings consist of several different layers - site, structure, skin, services, spaceplan, stuff. These layers change at different rates:

<ul>
<li>Site is unchanging</li>
<li>Structure lasts the lifetime of the building</li>
<li>Services are the electrical, mechanical, plumbing, cabling, etc, last 10-15 years</li>
<li>Spaceplan is the layout of partitions, wall panels, etc. which changes every 5 to 7 years</li>
<li>Stuff is the furniture, which changes on the order of weeks or months</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interaction mostly takes palce within a layer, and the slow moving layers define the set of options available to the other layers. Brand uses the analogy of a forest, where the hummingbirds don&#39;t notice the redwoods, but the redwoods define the forest.</li>
<li>Thus buildings are constantly changing and adapting over time, at different rates</li>
<li>It&#39;s best to not have all systems/structure combined, so the fast layers can change without damaging the slow layers, and the slow layers won&#39;t restrict the fast layers.</li>
<li>Problem with architecture is that it treats buildings as art and thus unable to be changed, when to be successful buildings need to be changed constantly throughout their lives, as society changes and the building is forced to change with it. Factories become lofts, warehouses become offices, etc.</li>
<li>If the building stock changes at 2-3% a year, a city completely renews every 50 years. Buildings shouldn&#39;t be treated as permanent, but should be considered changeable.</li>
<li>Zoning, real estate prices should encourage this changeability, but in practice often don&#39;t.

<ul>
<li>Overly strict zoning prevents adaptations to new uses taking place.</li>
<li>Rapidly falling prices mean it&#39;s not worth it to do mainteance (and all buildings need maintenance) and the building rots.</li>
<li>Rapidly increasing/expensive prices mean it&#39;s not worth it to try to keep a building as the cost is dominated by the land itself, and they&#39;re constantly being torn down and replaced.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
