#### Notes on Car

Tells the story of the development of the 3rd generation ford taurus.

What by historical standards is an unremarkable achievement (model refresh by a manufacturer of a product that has been around in one form or another for over a hundred years, barely mentions more than a few words on wikipedia) required a mobilization on the scale of going to war - 3 billion dollars spent, thousands and thousands of man hours over a 5 year period

products aren't just products, but bundles of sub-products developed by other companies who have the specific expertise in that one particular thing.
-"I pencil"
-Deepness in the sky

shows teh degree that cars push the limits and define what we mean by mass production. Herculean development efforts.

Test models that aren't mass-produced cost on the order of 20x as much as the mass produced versions.
