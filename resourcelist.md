# List of Structural Engineering Resources on the Net

Here's a list of engineering resources around the net I've found useful.

### Building Codes

- [Archive.org](http://archive.org/details/publicsafetycode) Public Safety Codes: Collection of various building codes available for download. Particularly useful is every version of the IBC – [2000](http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.2000), [2003](http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.2003), [2006](http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.2006), [2009](http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.209) and [2012](http://archive.org/details/gov.law.icc.ibc.2012).
- [Public.Resource.org Building Codes](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/): Another online code collection, largely overlaps with archive.org.
- [PublicCodes.Cyberregs.com](ttp://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/): Online code repository maintained by the ICC. Doesn’t allow downloading, and navigating is an extreme pain.
- [Up.Codes](https://up.codes/codes/): Online access to most state-specific building codes

### Wind and Earthquake Maps

- USGS Seismic Hazard Maps: Maps of ground acceleration used by ASCE.
- Wind Speed Map: Utility for finding wind speed, maintained by ATC.

### Old Construction

- structuralsafety.com: Several links to information on old rebar and old construction.
- Sliderule Era: Out of print engineering publications made freely available.

### Bridges

- [UglyBridges.com](http://uglybridges.com/): User-friendly interface for National Bridge Inventory data.
- [Nationalbridges.com](http://nationalbridges.com/): Another online parsing of NBI data.
- [Bridgehunter.com](http://bridgehunter.com/): Database of notable bridges, past and present.

### Engineering Magazines

- Structure Magazine: Articles on various structural engineering topics, available free (including all back issues). I particularly like their Antiquated Structural Systems series.
- Structural Engineer: Another structural engineering magazine.
- Modern Steel Construction: Articles focusing on steel construction. Current and back issues all freely available.

### Misc. Resources

- The Earthquake Engineering Online Archive (NISEE): Many publications about earthquake engineering. Membership costs a one-time fee of $25.
- S.K. Ghosh: Articles on structural engineering and building codes, written by one of the premier engineers of our time.
- Reed Construction Data: Economic and cost data for the construction industry, as well as a breakdown of the building code adoption by state.
- ASCE Library: If you feel like paying an arm and a leg, there’s a large library of structural engineering articles available.
- PCI Technical Resources: Back issues of the PCI Journal, load tables from every edition of the PCI handbook, and a variety of other precast design resources, all freely available.
- ACI Free Downloads: Freely available publications of some of the more minor ACI Committees. There’s also a large library of articles from the various ACI publications, many available for free to ACI members.
- AISC ePubs and freePubs: Technical publications from AISC, including journal articles and historical standards. Some require AISC to access.
- NFPA Research: Fire statistics and reports from the NFPA.
- Google Books: If it’s a hundred years old or so, it’s probably available for free on Google books. Lots of great engineering publications here.
- Historic American Engineering Record: Prints and photographs documenting achievements in architecture, engineering, and landscape design from the Library of Congress.
- FEMA Library: Library of freely available FEMA publications, including NEHRP publications.

### Simpson Resources

- Simpson Wood Connectors Catalog

### Forums and Mailing Lists

- ICC Code Forum: Discussion of the various I-Codes
- Eng-Tips: Forums for various engineering issues.
- SEAINT Mail Archive: Structural Engineer’s Association mailing list archive, going back to 1995.
- DesignToEurocodes.com: Forum for Eurocode design.
